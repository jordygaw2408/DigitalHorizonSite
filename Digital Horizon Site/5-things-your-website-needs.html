                        <p class="lead">Your website might look good, but is it actually working for you? Here are five critical elements that most business websites are missingâ€”and how to fix them.</p>

                        <p>I've reviewed hundreds of business websites over the years, and I see the same problems again and again. These aren't technical issues that require a developer to fix. They're fundamental elements that every business website needs to convert visitors into customers.</p>

                        <p>Let's dive in.</p>

                        <h2>1. Clear, Prominent Contact Information</h2>
                        <p>This sounds basic, but you'd be amazed how many websites make it difficult to get in touch. I've seen beautiful websites where I had to hunt for a phone number or email address.</p>

                        <h3>The Problem:</h3>
                        <p>When potential customers can't quickly find how to contact you, they leave. Simple as that. In today's world, if someone has to work to give you their business, they won't botherâ€”they'll just move on to your competitor.</p>

                        <h3>The Solution:</h3>
                        <p>Your contact information should be visible on every page. Here's where it needs to be:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>In your header or navigation menu</strong> - Phone number clearly visible</li>
                            <li><strong>In your footer</strong> - Full contact details including address</li>
                            <li><strong>On a dedicated contact page</strong> - Multiple ways to reach you</li>
                            <li><strong>In your mobile menu</strong> - One tap to call</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Bonus tip: Make your phone number clickable on mobile. Use <code>tel:</code> links so visitors can call you with a single tap. This seems obvious, but so many websites miss this.</p>

                        <h2>2. Mobile Responsiveness (Not Just Mobile-Friendly)</h2>
                        <p>Here's a stat that should wake you up: over 60% of web traffic now comes from mobile devices. For local businesses, that number is often even higherâ€”people searching "near me" on their phones.</p>

                        <h3>The Problem:</h3>
                        <p>Many websites claim to be "mobile-friendly" but actually provide a terrible mobile experience. Small text, buttons too close together, forms that are impossible to fill out on a phoneâ€”these all drive customers away.</p>

                        <h3>The Solution:</h3>
                        <p>Your website needs to work perfectly on mobile. That means:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Large, easy-to-tap buttons</strong> - At least 44x44 pixels</li>
                            <li><strong>Readable text without zooming</strong> - Minimum 16px font size</li>
                            <li><strong>Simple, thumb-friendly navigation</strong> - Easy to use with one hand</li>
                            <li><strong>Fast loading on mobile networks</strong> - Under 3 seconds</li>
                            <li><strong>Forms that work on small screens</strong> - Large input fields, minimal required information</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Test your website on your phone right now. Can you easily read everything? Can you fill out your contact form without frustration? If not, you're losing customers.</p>

                        <h2>3. Clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs)</h2>
                        <p>A call-to-action is simply telling visitors what you want them to do next. Sounds simple, right? Yet this is where most websites fall flat.</p>

                        <h3>The Problem:</h3>
                        <p>Visitors land on your website and think, "This looks nice, but what do I do now?" Without clear direction, they leave. You've lost a potential customer not because they weren't interested, but because you didn't tell them what to do.</p>

                        <h3>The Solution:</h3>
                        <p>Every page should have a clear, prominent call-to-action. Here are some examples:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Homepage:</strong> "Get Your Free Quote" or "Book a Consultation"</li>
                            <li><strong>Services page:</strong> "Start Your Project Today"</li>
                            <li><strong>About page:</strong> "Let's Work Together"</li>
                            <li><strong>Portfolio page:</strong> "Get Similar Results for Your Business"</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Your CTA buttons should be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Visually prominent (contrasting colour, decent size)</li>
                            <li>Action-oriented (not just "Click Here")</li>
                            <li>Relevant to the page content</li>
                            <li>Repeated throughout the page for longer content</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Think about it: if a visitor is interested in what you offer, make it as easy as possible for them to take the next step.</p>

                        <h2>4. Social Proof and Trust Signals</h2>
                        <p>People don't buy from businessesâ€”they buy from businesses they trust. Your website needs to build that trust quickly.</p>

                        <h3>The Problem:</h3>
                        <p>A website without testimonials, reviews, or proof of past work makes visitors wonder, "Can I trust this business?" In the absence of trust signals, they'll choose a competitor who provides them.</p>

                        <h3>The Solution:</h3>
                        <p>Add these trust-building elements to your website:</p>

                        <h4>Customer Testimonials</h4>
                        <p>Real quotes from real customers are incredibly powerful. Include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The customer's full name (not just "John D.")</li>
                            <li>Their photo if possible</li>
                            <li>Their location or business name</li>
                            <li>Specific results they achieved</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Portfolio or Case Studies</h4>
                        <p>Show examples of your work. Before-and-after photos, project descriptions, and results you've achieved for clients all help build credibility.</p>

                        <h4>Google Reviews</h4>
                        <p>Display your Google review rating prominently. If you have 4.8 stars from 50+ reviews, show it off! You can embed Google reviews directly on your website.</p>

                        <h4>Professional Credentials</h4>
                        <p>Relevant certifications, memberships, awards, or years in business all help establish credibility.</p>

                        <h4>Real Business Information</h4>
                        <p>A physical address, phone number, and company registration details show you're a legitimate business, not a fly-by-night operation.</p>

                        <h2>5. Fast Loading Speed</h2>
                        <p>This is the one most businesses completely overlookâ€”and it's costing them customers.</p>

                        <h3>The Problem:</h3>
                        <p>If your website takes more than 3 seconds to load, you're losing visitors before they even see your content. Studies show that 40% of visitors abandon a website that takes longer than 3 seconds to load.</p>

                        <p>Think about that: you could be losing nearly half your potential customers simply because your website is too slow.</p>

                        <h3>The Solution:</h3>
                        <p>Website speed is affected by several factors:</p>

                        <h4>Image Optimisation</h4>
                        <p>Large images are the biggest culprit for slow websites. Every photo should be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Properly sized (not 5000px wide when it displays at 800px)</li>
                            <li>Compressed without losing quality</li>
                            <li>In the right format (JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics)</li>
                            <li>Using modern formats like WebP when possible</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Good Web Hosting</h4>
                        <p>Cheap hosting is expensive in lost customers. Quality hosting costs a bit more per month but provides:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Faster server response times</li>
                            <li>Better reliability</li>
                            <li>Better security</li>
                            <li>Better support when you need it</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Clean, Modern Code</h4>
                        <p>Outdated plugins, unnecessary scripts, and bloated code all slow your website down. A professionally built website is optimised for speed from the start.</p>

                        <h3>How to Test Your Speed:</h3>
                        <p>Use Google PageSpeed Insights (it's free). Just enter your website URL and you'll get a score out of 100 plus specific recommendations for improvement.</p>

                        <p>Aim for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Green score (90+) on mobile</li>
                            <li>Green score (90+) on desktop</li>
                            <li>Load time under 3 seconds</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Quick Action Checklist</h2>
                        <p>Go through your website right now and check these five things:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>â˜ Can visitors easily find your phone number and email on every page?</li>
                            <li>â˜ Does your website work perfectly on your phone?</li>
                            <li>â˜ Does every page have a clear call-to-action telling visitors what to do next?</li>
                            <li>â˜ Do you have customer testimonials, reviews, and portfolio examples visible?</li>
                            <li>â˜ Does your website load in under 3 seconds?</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>If you answered "no" to any of these, you're losing potential customers. The good news? All of these are fixable.</p>

                        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                        <p>A beautiful website means nothing if it doesn't convert visitors into customers. These five elementsâ€”clear contact info, mobile responsiveness, strong CTAs, trust signals, and fast loadingâ€”are the foundation of a website that actually works for your business.</p>

                        <p>You don't need a complete redesign to implement these changes. Start with the biggest issues first and work your way through the list. Even small improvements can make a significant difference in how many enquiries you get.</p>

                        <h2>Need Help?</h2>
                        <p>If you're not sure where to start, or if you'd like an expert assessment of your website, we're here to help. At Digital Horizon, we specialise in creating websites that look great and actually drive business results.</p>

                        <p>We can audit your current website, identify what's holding it back, and create a plan to fix itâ€”or build you a new website that gets all of this right from day one.</p>
